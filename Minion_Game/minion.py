# Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.
#
# Game Rules
#
# Both players are given the same string, .
# Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string .
# Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
# Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
# The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.
#
# Scoring
# A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string .
#
# For Example:
# String  = BANANA
# Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
# Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.
